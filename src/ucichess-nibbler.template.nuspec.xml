        <description>
            Nibbler is a real-time analysis GUI for Leela Chess Zero (Lc0), which runs Leela in the background and
            constantly displays opinions about the current position. You can also compel the engine to evaluate one or
            more specific moves. Nibbler is loosely inspired by Lizzie and Sabaki.
            These days, Nibbler more-or-less works with traditional engines like Stockfish, too. (Ensure MultiPV is 1,
            Threads (CPU) is set, and Hash is set (more is better), for maximum strength.)
            For prebuilt binary releases, see the Releases section. For help, the Discord may be your best bet, or open
            an issue here.
